Shapes
============

One of the fundamental aspects of Gamma is that anything that can be interacted with has a bounding box that is used for collision detection. For now, Gamma only supports rectangular bounding boxes, however this may change in the future.

To provide the functionality required for a bounding box, we have a a set of functions and properties that can be added to your object using :api:`gma.shapes.rectangle`.

.. note:: Gamma provides several entity classes out of the box that use :api:`gma.shapes.rectangle`. Look at the descendants list on that api page for a full list of such classes.

Creating a rectangle
--------------------

.. _rectangle:

To specify a rectangle, you need to be able to determine it's width, height and position using the available properties. Gamma allows you to specify this in several ways, as outlined below. If these aspects can't be determined, then the rectangle can't be made and :api:`gma.shapes.rectangle` will return ``null``.

Specifying width and horizontal position
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Any of the following combinations will allow you to specify a width and horizontal position, where ``x`` is the horizontal co-ordinate of the centre of the rectangle, ``left`` and ``right`` are the horizontal extremes of the rectangle and ``width`` is it's absolute width.

 * ``width`` and ``right``
 * ``width`` and ``left``
 * ``width`` and ``x``
 * ``left`` and ``right``
 * ``x`` and ``left``
 * ``x`` and ``right``
 
Specifying height and vertical position
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Any of the following combinations will allow you to specify a height and vertical position, where ``y`` is the vertical co-ordinate of the centre of the rectangle, ``top`` and ``bottom`` are the vertical extremes of the rectangle and ``height`` is it's absolute height.

 * ``height`` and ``bottom``
 * ``height`` and ``top``
 * ``height`` and ``y``
 * ``top`` and ``bottom``
 * ``y`` and ``top``
 * ``y`` and ``bottom``
 
Examples

.. code-block:: javascript
    
	// top, bottom, right and left
	gma.platform({left:1, right:3, top:3, bottom:2});
	
	// (top or bottom), (left or right), height and width
	gma.platform({bottom:1, right:3, height:1, width:2});
	gma.platform({bottom:1, left:1,  height:1, width:2});
	gma.platform({top:2,    right:3, height:1, width:2});
	gma.platform({top:2,    left:1,  height:1, width:2});
	
	// (top or bottom), left, right and height
	gma.platform({bottom:1, right:3, left:1, height:1});
	gma.platform({top:2,    right:3, left:1, height:1});
	
	// (left or right), top, bottom and width
	gma.platform({left:1,  bottom:1, width:2});
	gma.platform({right:3, bottom:1, width:2});
	
	// centre, width and height
	gma.platform({ centre:[2,1.5], width:2, height:1 });
	
	// x, y, width and height
	gma.platform({ x:2, y:1.5, width:2, height:1 });
    
Specifying Points
+++++++++++++++++

An *alternative* way of specifying a rectangle is to specify points that make up the corners of the rectangle. This is done by specifying ``points`` with an array of [x,y] co-ordinates. How many points you supply and in what order is up to you, as long as you have at least two diagonally opposite corners, then it will work.

Examples
++++++++

For example, creating a :api:`gma.platform`, which uses :api:`gma.shapes.rectangle`.

.. code-block:: javascript

	// All four corners
	gma.platform({ points:[[1,1],[3,1],[3,2],[1,2]] });
	
	// 2 opposite corners
	gma.platform({ points:[[1,1],[3,2]] });
	gma.platform({ points:[[3,1],[1,2]] });
