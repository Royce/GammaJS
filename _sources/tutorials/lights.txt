Adding Lights
=======================

To add a light to your level you can specify options under the ``light`` label inside your level specification. For example:

.. code-block:: javascript

   var myLevel = {
        light : {
            myLight : { 
                //options
            }
        }
    };
    

We will define a point (directional) light. The light is position 5 units above and 20 units in front of the character (therefore, an offset of [0,5,20]). We must also rotate it 180 degrees (1.54 radians) to point into the scene (and at the character). The light will emit a white light:

.. code-block:: javascript

    var myLevel = {
        light : {
            myLight : {
                type : GLGE.L_POINT,
                rotY : 1.54,
                color    : "#fff",
                attached : ['character', 0,5,20]
            }
        }
    };
